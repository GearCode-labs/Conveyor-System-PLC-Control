Project Title:
Conveyor System PLC Control

Description:
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a conveyor system control project implemented using Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). The system is designed to efficiently manage the movement of items along a conveyor belt, demonstrating the principles of automation and industrial control. The codebase includes the PLC logic, HMI interfaces, and any additional components necessary for the seamless operation of the conveyor system. Contributions, issues, and feedback are welcome as we aim to continuously improve and expand the functionality of this project.

Key Features:
PLC logic for conveyor system control.
Human Machine Interface (HMI) integration.
Documentation for system architecture and usage.

Technologies Used:
PLC Programming (Specify the PLC model, e.g., Siemens S7-1200).
Human Machine Interface (HMI) Development.
